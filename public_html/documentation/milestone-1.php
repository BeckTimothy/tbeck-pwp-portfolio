		<h1>Purpose, Audience, Goal:</h1>

		<h1>Purpose:</h1>
		<p>The purpose of my PWP is to provide a dynamic Resume, Portfolio, an 'About Me' profile, and contact containers within the page to provide potential employers and clients to hire me for my programming/development skills.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Audience:</h1>
		<p>My audience is professional peers who may be interested in working with me on projects, potential employers who may be interested in hiring me, and clients interested in contracting my skills.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Goal:</h1>
		<p>My goal is to acquire full-time employment, grow my professional network, and to attract freelance clients.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1>Persona:</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Lando Rock, who for 12 years was the 'head of hiring' as the Senior Vice President of People Operations at Google, is a 50 year old American from Italy. He graduated from Arizona State College with a BA and Yale school of management with an MBA. When hiring, Rock weighs skills that relate to learning new things and solving problems as the most important skills in potential employees. He seems to be very positive and passionate about his workplace, peers, and technology. His goal is to gain more information on the potential new hire portrayed through my website. Utilizing Github, and LinkedIn to vett potential employees during onboarding he can ask them related questions to their skills to gain a better understanding of their skill level as developers.</p>
