		<h1>Purpose, Audience, Goal:</h1>
		<br>
		<h1>Purpose:</h1>
		<p>The purpose of my PWP is to provide a dynamic Resume, Portfolio, an 'About Me' profile, and contact containers within the page to provide potential employers and clients to hire me for my programming/development skills.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Audience:</h1>
		<p>My audience is professional peers who may be interested in working with me on projects, potential employers who may be interested in hiring me, and clients interested in contracting my skills.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Goal:</h1>
		<p>My goal is to acquire full-time employment, grow my professional network, and to attract freelance clients.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1>Persona:</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Laszlo Bock, who for 10 years was the 'head of hiring' as the Senior Vice President of People Operations at Google, is a 47 year old American from Romainia, born from Hungarian parents. He graduated from Pomona College with a BA and Yale school of management with an MBA. When hiring, Bock weighs skills that relate to learning new things and solving problems as the most important skills in potential employees. He seems to be very positive and passionate about his workplace, peers, and technology. His goal is to gain more information on the potential new hire portrayed through my website.</p>
