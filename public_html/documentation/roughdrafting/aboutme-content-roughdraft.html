			<p>I'm Timothy Beck, I love learning, experiencing new challenges, and discussing interesting concepts. Through
				diligent
				studying and networking with other professionals, I hope to gain a firm footing in the development industry
				and kick
				down the door at businesses that can potentially hire a developer with an avid drive to learn as much as
				possible in
				the realm of programming.</p>

			<p>In my free time, I operate as a manager of an online community with focuses on esports and a rich social
				media
				presence. I've taken a leadership position where I spearhead the recruitment process, vetting of new
				members, and
				monitor their progress as they become contributing members of our organization. I often coordinate with
				sometimes
				thousands of members of similar communities to collect and analyze data for our organization to make the
				proper
				actions to achieve our goals.</p>

			<p>I’ve held many positions across various industries, and one thing that has always stuck with me has been the
				value of
				a dependable coworker. The practices of one person could impact all employees in an organization, saving
				company
				time, money, and improving workplace atmosphere. From this realization, I’ve always strived to become this
				dependable
				coworker willing to pick up extra hours, learn new skills, and always present a positive attitude to
				encourage my
				workspace to become a more efficient and positive work environment.</p>

			<p>My ideal career is one that provides many challenges to overcome and an environment that keeps up with the
				rapidly
				changing tech industry, providing many learning opportunities and new skill sets. I want to be surrounded by
				highly
				motivated people who I can learn from and share my future successes with. I'm interested in many aspects of
				Web
				Development, as I love creating new things and seeing my creations improve over time.</p>
