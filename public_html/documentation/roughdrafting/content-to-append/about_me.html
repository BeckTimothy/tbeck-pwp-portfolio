			networking with other professionals, I hope to gain a firm footing in the development industry
			and kick down the door at businesses that can potentially hire a developer with an avid drive to
			learn as much as possible in the realm of programming.&lt;/</a><a class="m">p</a><a

			of an online community with focuses on esports and a rich social media presence. I've taken a
			leadership position where I spearhead the recruitment process, vetting of new members, and
			monitor their progress as they become contributing members of our organization. I often
			coordinate with sometimes thousands of members of similar communities to collect and analyze
			data for our organization to make the proper actions to achieve our goals.&lt;/</a><a

			various industries, and one thing that has always stuck with me has been the value of a
			dependable coworker. The practices of one person could impact all employees in an
			organization, saving company time, money, and improving workplace atmosphere. From this
			realization, I’ve always strived to become this dependable coworker willing to pick up
			extra hours, learn new skills, and always present a positive attitude to encourage my
			workspace to become a more efficient and positive work environment.&lt;/</a><a class="m">p</a><a

			provides many challenges to overcome and an environment that keeps up with the rapidly
			changing tech industry, providing many learning opportunities and new skill sets. I
			want to be surrounded by highly motivated people who I can learn from and share my
			future successes with. I'm interested in many aspects of Web Development, as I love
			creating new things and seeing my creations improve over time.&lt;/</a><a class="m">p</a><a
